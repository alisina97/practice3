Here’s a friendly message you could send:

Hi Karen,

I hope you’re doing well! I recently connected with Darren, and he had wonderful things to say about your team and experience at BMO. As a UX intern here myself, I’d love the chance to meet for a quick coffee chat, if you have some time. I’d really enjoy hearing about your team’s journey and any advice you might have for someone in my shoes.

Looking forward to connecting!

Best,
Ali
